# Apache Kafka - An Introduction

This is the repo for the session on Apache Kafka for JavaScript devs. 

The repo is structured as follows :- 

 - root
   - presentation
   - code 

The `presentation` directory hosts the codebase for running the presentation whereas sample codebase is hosted under the `code` directory. 

The `code` directory is a NodeJS source root like any other node project.

Each directory contains its specific README to help you follow the session.
